# 📸 Image Caption Generator  

Hey there! 👋 This is an **AI-powered Image Caption Generator** that takes an image as input and generates a meaningful description—just like a human would! 🤖✨  

Using deep learning techniques like **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)**, this model learns to recognize objects and describe them in natural language.  

---

## 📌 What's Inside?  

### 🖼 **Image Processing with CNN**  
The model extracts key visual features using a **pretrained CNN** (like VGG16 or InceptionV3).  

### 🧠 **Caption Generation with LSTM**  
Once the features are extracted, the LSTM model generates **contextual captions** based on the image.  

### 📊 **Trained on the Flickr8k Dataset**  
The model is trained on **8,000+ images** with human-annotated captions, making its predictions more accurate.

## 🚀 How to Get Started  

### 1️⃣ **Download the Dataset**  
You'll need the **Flickr8k dataset**, which you can grab from Kaggle:  
🔗 [Download Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k?resource=download)  

### 2️⃣ **Set Up Your Environment**  
#### Option A: Run on **Google Colab** (Recommended)  
- Upload the dataset to **Google Drive**  
- Mount your drive in Colab:  
  ```python
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
  ```
- Update the dataset path accordingly  

#### Option B: Run Locally on **Jupyter Notebook**  
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib nltk
  ```
- Open the `.ipynb` file and set the correct dataset path  

### 3️⃣ **Run the Model**  
Just execute the cells in the notebook, and watch the AI describe images! 🖼➡️📝

## 🎯 Example  

### 📷 **Input:** *(An image of a woman climbing a rock)*  
✍️ **Generated Caption:**  
> `"A woman is climbing up a rock face."`
